# Congress hearings
This repository contains the codes I developed to analyze the content of oral testimony delivered by congressional committee witnesses. 

A preprint of my work is available here: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vak93/ - this should be interpreted with caution because I'm currently working on feedback received from the Policy Studies Journal, which highlighted a number of issues that need to be resolved. 

This includes code for quantifying:

- keywords in congressional witness oral testimony (keyword_count.R)
- congressional committee chairs representing different parties (committee_chairs.R)
- the number of committee members representing the top 5 states for COVID deaths in different months (committee_statedeaths.R)
- the number of committee members representing a state that implemented mandatory stay home orders in different months (committee_statestayhome.R)
- the number of committee members representing the top 5 states for unemployment in different months (committee_stateunemploy.R)
- the proportion of certain witness types (witness_type.R)
