# Congress hearings
This repository contains the codes I developed to analyze the content of oral testimony delivered by congressional committee witnesses.

This includes code for quantifying:

- keywords in congressional witness oral testimony (keyword_count.R)
- congressional committee chairs representing different parties (committee_chairs.R)
- the number of committee members representing the top 5 states for COVID deaths in different months (committee_statedeaths.R)
- the number of committee members representing a state that implemented mandatory stay home orders in different months (committee_statestayhome.R)
- the number of committee members representing the top 5 states for unemployment in different months (committee_stateunemploy.R)
- the proportion of certain witness types (witness_type.R)
